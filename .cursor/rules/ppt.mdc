## HTML Slide Navigation Specification

### Key Features
- A visually appealing slide-based presentation using HTML and CSS.
- Navigation buttons placed at the left and right edges of the screen.
- A persistent page indicator at the bottom showing the current position.
- Keyboard arrow keys (left/right) for navigation.
- Prevent navigation beyond the last slide with a toast notification.
- **Support for embedding dynamic charts using ApexCharts.**
- **Utilization of Feather Icons for a modern UI experience.**

---

### Slide Structure
- Each slide is a full-page section.
- Slides should have a consistent styling for a clean and modern appearance.
- Content should be centered within each slide.

```html
<div class="slide-container">
    <div class="slide active">Slide 1 Content</div>
    <div class="slide">Slide 2 Content</div>
    <div class="slide">Slide 3 Content</div>
    ...
</div>
```

---

### Navigation System
#### 1. **Navigation Buttons (with Icons)**
- Always visible at the left and right edges.
- Styled to be unobtrusive but clear.
- Clickable to move between slides.
- Uses **Feather Icons** for a clean look.

```html
<button id="prev-slide" class="nav-button">
    <i data-feather="arrow-left"></i>
</button>
<button id="next-slide" class="nav-button">
    <i data-feather="arrow-right"></i>
</button>
```

#### 2. **Keyboard Navigation**
- `Arrow Left (←)`: Move to the previous slide.
- `Arrow Right (→)`: Move to the next slide.
- If at the last slide, display a toast notification instead of proceeding further.

#### 3. **Page Indicator (with Icons)**
- A progress indicator at the bottom of the screen.
- Shows the current slide number out of the total slides.
- Updates dynamically when navigating.
- Uses **Feather Icons** for aesthetics.

```html
<div class="page-indicator">
    <i data-feather="circle"></i>
    <span id="slide-number">1 / X</span>
</div>
```

---

### Toast Notification (with Icon)
- Appears when attempting to navigate past the last slide.
- Disappears automatically after a few seconds.
- Includes an **alert icon** for better visual feedback.

```html
<div id="toast" class="hidden">
    <i data-feather="alert-circle"></i>
    <span>You have reached the last slide.</span>
</div>
```

---

### Chart Integration
- Use **ApexCharts** for embedding dynamic and interactive charts.
- Include the following script in the document:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts@3.46.0/dist/apexcharts.min.js"></script>
```

- Place a container inside a slide to hold the chart:

```html
<div id="chart-container"></div>
```

- Example chart initialization:

```html
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    var options = {
        chart: {
            type: 'line',
            height: 350
        },
        series: [{
            name: 'Sample Data',
            data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
        }],
        xaxis: {
            categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
        }
    };

    var chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector("#chart-container"), options);
    chart.render();
});
</script>
```

---

### Feather Icons Integration
To ensure Feather Icons work properly, include the following script at the end of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
      feather.replace();
  });
</script>
```

---

### Performance & Accessibility
- Ensure smooth transitions between slides.
- Use ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- Optimize for responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Provide fallback for users without JavaScript.
